## Project description
Ikshana is a fully autonomous drone that operates in a parking lot. It checks the empty parking spots and then assists the cars by directing them to an ideal vacant parking spot, by the help of LED Blinkers.

### Project idea
•	We came up with the concept of using drones to search for parking spots, this alleviates the problem of having to do it manually which is tedious and time consuming. It will help us save time and effort.
•	The driver will be able to see our drone, which will lead the vehicle to the parking location. 
• The drone's arms include programmable LEDs. By blinking in a relay pattern, these LEDs will direct you down the path, whether to turn right, left, continue or stop.
•	The drone is equipped with sensors to maintain a safe distance in all direction and avoid obstacles

### The potential outcomes
Getting around parking lots can be annoying at times and finding a vacant spot in the parking lot is a time-consuming and difficult task. Ikshana will help the driver reach an ideal parking spot.
Such a system is really helpful in parking lots as it avoids hassles and comotion while also reduceing labor and being more efficient.

### Using Clover platform
The Clover-COEX platform is used for simulating and implementing OpenCV, ROS for the drone. It helps us integrate ROS with our Rasberry Pi.
